# Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio project, where I have leveraged HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create a professional looking portfolio website. This website will showcase my work, skills, and experience to potential clients or employers.

## Files and Folders

The main file in this project is index.html, which serves as the starting point for the portfolio website. This file contains all the HTML markup for the website, including the heading, navigation links, about me section, contact section, and projects section.

The CSS files are in the "css" folder, where styles.css contains all the CSS styling for the website, and normalize.css is a CSS reset library to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.

The JavaScript files are in the "js" folder, where script.js contains all the JavaScript code for the website, including a hamburger menu, form validation, and smooth scrolling on page anchors.

The "assets" folder contains all the images, fonts, and icons used in the website.

## Installation

There is no installation required to view this portfolio website. Simply open the index.html file in your web browser to view the website.

## Usage

This personal portfolio can be used by anyone who wants to showcase their work, skills, and experience to potential clients or employers. The website can be customized by changing the text, images, and projects to match personal preferences.
